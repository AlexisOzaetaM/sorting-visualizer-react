# :lobster: Sorting Visualizer Project
A SPA developed with React JS to show how sorting algorithms work .  [Try it here!](https://alexisozaetam.github.io/sorting-visualizer-react/ "Try it here!")

## What is this? Why?
This is a personal project with the original intention of learn and implement sorting algorithms and see them in action.

## Inspiration
I saw this project idea from **Clément Mihailescu** [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g "Clément Mihailescu's YouTube channel") where he shows how to implement Merge Sort algorithm in a visual way using React JS.

You can see his work on his GitHub account here: https://github.com/clementmihailescu :octocat:
